#Lion Cub
Lion Cub is a lightweight and modular CSS library to get your next project up and running. It includes resets and basic styles for necessary and commonly used objects to build applications. These include: forms, type, lists, buttons, etc. Lion Cub leaves out bloated and commonly unused components. Lion Cub can be best described as a hybrid of [BassCSS](http://www.basscss.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Lion Cub is also the predecessor to the React component library [Lion](https://github.com/BrewhouseTeam/lion).

##Getting Started

###CDN
Lion Cub will soon be hosted using [NPM CDN](https://npmcdn.com/#/). Compiled CSS file for each module will be available. Check back soon. 

###Node
`npm install https://github.com/lmnelson/lion-cub.git --save-dev`

Lion Cub comes compiled as `build/dist/dist.css`. Simply add this file to your project and voila. You can also choose to import the source files directly if you are using PostCSS and have all of the correct dependencies. Check the `package.json` file for reference. 

###Rails 
Lion Cub is currently only available via NPM. Lion Cub will however be backwards compatible with SASS in the future thus making the source files available for Rails.

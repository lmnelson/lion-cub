#Lion Cub
Lion Cub is a lightweight and modular CSS library to get your next project up and running. It includes resets and basic styles for necessary and commonly used objects to build applications, such as: forms, type, lists, buttons. It leaves out bloated and commonly unused components. To sum things up, Lion Cub is a hybrid of BassCSS and Bootstrap. Lion Cub is also the predecessor to the React component library Lion.

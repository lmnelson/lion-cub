#Lion Cub
Lion Cub is a lightweight and modular CSS library to get your next project up and running. It includes resets and basic styles for necessary and commonly used objects to build applications. These include: forms, type, lists, buttons, etc. Lion Cub leaves out bloated and commonly unused components. Lion Cub can be best described as a hybrid of [BassCSS](http://www.basscss.com/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Lion Cub is also the predecessor to the React component library [Lion](https://github.com/BrewhouseTeam/lion).
